# What Are We Creating? (A Simple Story)

Imagine you want to connect with experts for advice, just like calling a friend for help, but with professionals from around the world. This project is building a platform where users can find advisors, book calls, and get guidance on any topic—whether it's life, business, or learning a new skill. Advisors set their rates, users can search by expertise, and everything is managed securely with profiles, feedback, and wallet transactions. It's like having a global advice hotline, right at your fingertips!
